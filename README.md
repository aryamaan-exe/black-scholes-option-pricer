# Black-Scholes Option Pricer

This is a project I made to understand more about the Black-Scholes model. It's a calculator that lets you enter 5 input variables and gives you the appropriate call and put price. It also lets you generate a heatmap of the call price with varying stock prices and volatilities. This lets you estimate the implied volatility.

## Tutorial

The project comes with a tutorial section explaining options, the Black-Scholes model, and the project itself. As for running the code locally, you'll be using Next.js and HeroUI, plus Python for the backend. This also uses ImageKit for the heatmaps, [see how to get an ImageKit API key here](https://imagekit.io/docs/overview).

## History

I wanted to make a project about the Black-Scholes model for a while, understanding how it works in theory and how to code it. I started working on it during Hack Club Summer of Making.
